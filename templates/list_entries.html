    <h2>Briefly about me</h2>
    <div class="post-content">
    <p>
      In 2014 I spent a year learning to code, attended the <a href="http://www.codefellows.org">Codefellows Bootcamp</a>,
      and now I work as a backend developer at <a href="http://www.offerupnow.com">OfferUp</a>.
      <br>
      <br>
      I code primarily in Python and make web apps in Django / Flask.  I love the open source movement and try to share as much code as possible. The code for this blog can be found <a href="https://github.com/johnshiver/learning_journal">here</a>.
      <br>
      <br>
      I also love <a href="https://soundcloud.com/john-shiver">music</a> and <a href="/books">read</a> as much as possible. Right now, outside of programming nothing interests me more than China.
